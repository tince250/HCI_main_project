          <br>On the right is the card pane, with scrolling view of different types of cards on the bottom, and search & filter bar on the top.

			<p>Navbar is the main source of navigation in the app. It allows you to choose from 4 different card display types:</p>
            <ul class="p-ul">
                <li>Tours</li>
                <li>Accommodation</li>
                <li>Attractions</li>
                <li>Restaurants</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Selecting either one of these options will change the content and look (slightly) of the cards on the right, displaying information for the chosen entities.
            <br> Read more about different card displays <a href="#cards-div">here</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
             Right below those four type-oriented options, there's an option for you to open "Tour History".
             <br>
             This option will open up the history view on the right pane, showing all the tours you reserved and/or booked.<br>More on that <a href="#history-div">here</a>.

                <p>Tour Card is designated for displaying tours. It shows tour image, price, name, dates => basic information about each tour.</p>
                <p>Tours are the whole planned trips our agents prepared just for you. Each tour includes different restaurants, accommodation and attractions you'll get to enjoy during the tour.
                    <br>
                    To see the whole tour plan and description, and get a chance to book/reserve a tour, click on the "Information" button on the bottom left - more on that <a href="#information-div">(just like this one)</a></p>

                <p>Clicking on the "Information" button will open a window with detailed information about the tour. Besides the information on the card, tour description and tour attractions, accommodation and restaurant will show.
                    <br>
                    Handy Map view of all information will also be displayed - including color-coordinated markers for each of the accommodation/attractions/restaurants included, and the path connecting all attractions you'll get to explore during the trip.
                    <br>
                    <p>To read more about tour information page, click "F1" or "?" button on the information page of your interest (while running the app).</p>

                <p>Simple Card is designated for displaying attractions, accommodation, and restaurants - one card for all of them because they hold the same families of informations. It shows image, name, and address information of each item.</p>
                <p>Unlike Tours, attractions, accommodation, and restaurants don't have much information about them - each of them has its address (Street, Street Number, Postal Code, City), and on top of that accommodation also has its type (hotel/apartment).</p>

			<p>Tour History navbar button will open the overview of all Tours you booked and/or reserved through the app.
                

            </p>
            
            <p>It also displays a elongated version of Tour cards, with all the same infomation as before (in a bit of a different layout).</p>
            <img class="element-image" height="140" src="images/HistoryCard.png"  /> 
            <p>Each tour history card has a label in the bottom right corner indicating the status of your purchase. It can be:</p>
            <ul class="p-ul">
                <li>booked - you booked the tour</li>
                <li>reserved - you reserved the tour</li>
            </ul>
            <p>*Reminder: "booking" a tour means paying and not beeing able to cancel the booking afterwards, while reservations don't require immediate purchase and can be later canceled.

            </p>
            <p>
                If the tour status is "reserved" and the tour dates are in the future, you have the option to cancel the tour - a gray "Cancel reservation" button will be placed right before the status label.
            </p>
            <img class="element-image" height="500" src="images/cancel.png"  /> 
            <p>
                
                To cancel a tour, simply click on the "Cancel reservation" button. Just to be sure, a "Are you sure you want to cancel" pop-up will appear, to prevent any accidents.
                <br>
                If you are sure, click on the blue "Cancel reservation" button, otherwise choose to "Cancel" and close the pop-up.

                Sort drop down menu is located to the right of the Search bar. Sorting is only available for tours (both in the "Tours" and "Tour Statistics" view).
            </p>
            <img class="element-image" height="500" src="images/sortT.png"  /> 
            <p>There are five sorting criteria:</p>
            <ul class="p-ul">
                <li>Most popular - cards will be sorted by the number of reservations and bookings (in sum) so that the first tour shown is the "most popular"</li>
                <li>Price lowest - cards will be sorted by the price so that the first tour shown is the the cheapest</li>
                <li>Price highest - cards will be sorted by the price so that the first tour shown is the the priciest</li>
                <li>Date desc - cards will be sorted by the the "from" date, so that the first tour shown starts the latest</li>
                <li>Date asc - cards will be sorted by the the "from" date, so that the first tour shown starts the soonest</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Sort is automatically applied after choosing one of the sorting criteria option from the dropdown, no need to click any extra buttons:</p>

                Filter button is located in the top right corner of the Homepage.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you first open the app, the filters are hidden. To make them visible simply click on the filter button => filter options outlined with gray border container will appear:
                
            </p>
			<img class="element-image" height="500" src="images/filterToursT.png"  /> 
            <p>Now you can choose to filter the items shown by different criteria, based on the item type:</p>
            <ul class="p-ul">
                <li>Tours - filter by min and max price, as well as date range</li>
                <li>Attractions - filter by attraction location (choose city option from the drop down menu)</li>
                <li>Accommodation - filter by accommodation location (choose city option from the drop down menu), as well as accommodation type (choose type option from drom down menu)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you're happy with the choices for filters you inputed, click on the "Apply filters" button to filter the card selection - only the cards who's content matches the filter inputs will remain.
                <br>
                Keep in mind: "Apply filters" button will be disabled (you won't be able to click it) unless the inputs you provided are valid - just follow error messages and make sure to correct the explained mistakes, and the button will enable after everything is corrected.
            </p>
            <img class="element-image" height="500" src="images/applied filtersT.png"  /> 
            <p>
                Filtering takes into consideration the search and sort values (if provided) so the final selection will contain cards that match all three criteria (given by search, sort and filters).
            </p>
            <p>To clear all filters at the same time, press the "Clear filters" button - cards will update to include only the criteria left by search and sort (if they exist).</p>
